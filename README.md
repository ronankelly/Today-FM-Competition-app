Today-FM-Competition-app
========================

Simple app that I use for entering competitions from "The last word" radio show

This is more just a personal app.  I usually find myself in the car on the way home from work listening to "The Last Word" on TodayFM.  Usually there's a sms based multiple choice competition run every day.  Rather than having to ener the string every time I enter, I wrote this simple app so I can just press a button to send the text.  Over time it's changed slightly - usually the format is "1..2..3" followed by a space then your name, but sometimes it can be "A..B..C" and sometimed you need to add in your location at the end.  You can choose those options in the settings.

So, simple app.  The main activity just has 3 buttons.  There's a settings menu option which uses PreferenceFragment and stores the values in the apps SharedPreferences.
